👋 Hi, I'm Ana Maria, also known as MESTIZANA on GitHub.
👀 I'm interested in data analysis with a social and political focus, as well as overall data analysis and visualization.
🌱 I'm currently learning and expanding my skills in Python, SQL, and other relevant technologies.
💞️ I'm looking to collaborate with private companies, NGOs, or governmental organizations worldwide to contribute towards bridging data gaps.
