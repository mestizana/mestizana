👋 Hi, I'm Ana Maria, also known as MESTIZANA on GitHub.

👀 I'm interested in data analysis with a social and political focus, as well as overall data analysis and visualization.

🌱 I'm currently expanding my skills in Python and SQL.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate with private companies, NGOs, or governmental organizations worldwide to contribute towards bridging data gaps.

📫 You can reach me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-mar%C3%ADa-chalela-gonz%C3%A1lez-1b2254244/.
